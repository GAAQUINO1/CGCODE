Alfie: It’s short and sweet and to the point. 
Cloud Girl: Glad it’s working for you! 
Cloud Girl: I went to a tutoring session to get help, said it was for a creative writing class. 
Alfie: Isn’t that risky?
Cloud Girl: Why would it be risky?
Alfie: Aren’t you trying to keep things under wraps?
Cloud Girl: Well, obviously. I wore my mask to the meeting, and I had a classmate sign up for it. 
Alfie: Okay. That seems fine, actually.

[IT_IS_FINE]

[DECISIVE]
Alfie: Alright, here's a good first task. 
Cloud Girl: Lay it on me!
Alfie: It looks like someone needs help taking their groceries back to their dorm. They just got off the bus and are stranded with too much to carry. 
Cloud Girl: On it. What's their location?

[PRESENT_OPTION]
Alfie: Let me run a situation by you, see how you feel. 
Cloud Girl: Sure, let’s feel things out first!
Alfie: It looks like someone needs help taking their groceries back to their dorm. They just got off the bus and are stranded with too much to carry.
Cloud Girl: That sounds pretty critical. We wouldn't want any frozen items to go bad. Looks like a job for Cloud Girl!
Alfie: Roger that. We'll review the other requests after we're done with this. 
Cloud Girl: Sounds good! What's their location?

[MERGE]
Alfie: Not far, it's the bus stop closest to you.

Cloud Girl: You know what would be cute? If I started carrying around reusable bags. The little ones, where they zip up all nice and then you pull them out to have a bag. 
Alfie: You expect to be helping with a lot more people's grocery runs?
Cloud Girl: Wouldn't hurt to be prepared! Plus, we could get cute custom-made cloud shaped ones. It would be on brand!

Like the idea | Hesitant about it | Think the idea is tacky

[LIKE_THE_IDEA]
Alfie: That's not a bad idea. Not something we could immediately set in motion, but I could look into some options.
Cloud Girl: That's the Alfie I know!
Alfie: Ha, okay, but don't get your hopes up. I can't promise anything.

[HESITANT_ABOUT_IT]
Alfie: Might be tricky, I don't exactly have Cloud Girl merch in the budget.
Cloud Girl: We have a budget?
Alfie: Exactly.

[THINK_THE_IDEA_IS_TACKY]
Alfie: Really? Branded merchandise already? Might be a bit tacky. 
Cloud Girl: Maybe you're right. We can put merch aside for the moment. Revisit it later.
Alfie: I'll put a pin in it.
