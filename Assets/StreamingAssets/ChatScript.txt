it’s a quiet evening on the rooftop above the forest-side dorms.
cloudgirl adjusts her goggles. alfie hums over the comms, relaxed.
a gentle breeze. distant birdsong.

[CHOICE]
check the hill path | look down at the courtyard | scan the treetops

[CHECK_THE_HILL_PATH]
she spots something moving near the trail. slow, careful.
it’s a deer, head low, munching grass.

[LOOK_DOWN_AT_THE_COURTYARD]
she leans over the edge.
two deer are nibbling flowers by the bike racks.
they glance up, unbothered.

[SCAN_THE_TREETOPS]
she scans the canopy.
a flicker of motion — a deer walking along the ridge, then vanishing into green.

[MERGE]
the deer are everywhere tonight.
she smiles, tugs her hoodie tighter.
it feels like a good night to just exist.

[CHOICE]
follow one quietly | sketch them | radio alfie

[SKETCH_THEM | FOLLOW_ONE_QUIETLY]
she pulls out a little notebook from her utility pouch.
soft steps. sketch lines. breathing slow.

[RADIO_ALFIE]
cloudgirl: deer. like, three of them.
alfie: confirmed visual. majestic creatures.
she laughs quietly.

[MERGE]
they don’t say anything else for a while.
they just listen to the forest.
