Alfie: It’s short and sweet and to the point. 
Cloud Girl: Glad it’s working for you! 
Cloud Girl: I went to a tutoring session to get help, said it was for a creative writing class. 
Alfie: Isn’t that risky?
Cloud Girl: Why would it be risky?
Alfie: Aren’t you trying to keep things under wraps?
Cloud Girl: Well, obviously. I wore my mask to the meeting, and I had a classmate sign up for it. 
Alfie: Okay. That seems fine, actually.

[IT_IS_FINE]
