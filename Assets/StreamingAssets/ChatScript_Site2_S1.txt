Alfie: The post goes into detail about the type of bike, the last time they had it, and what leads they've got. 
Cloud Girl: Break it down for me. 
Alfie: The user says they forgot to put their lock on their bike one day before work, and when they left for the day, it was gone. 
Cloud Girl: That's awful 
Alfie: Yeah, ever since then, it's been a struggle for them to commute to their job. 
Alfie: They also clarified they never filed a police report, so insurance isn't an option. 
Alfie: They just want to know any leads on their bike. 
Cloud Girl: How are we supposed to start looking for it? 
Alfie: Someone in the comments says they saw a bike that matches that description near MacHenry Library. 
Alfie: That's a good first place to start. 
Cloud Girl: Alright, counting on you for navigation.

Cloud Girl: Isn't that stealing? 
Alfie: Technically, stealing from another thief. 
Cloud Girl: I suppose you're right.
