Alfie: Alright, here's a good first task. 
Cloud Girl: Lay it on me!
Alfie: It looks like someone needs help taking their groceries back to their dorm. They just got off the bus and are stranded with too much to carry. 
Cloud Girl: On it. What's their location?

[PITCH_OPTION]
Alfie: Let me run a situation by you, see how you feel. 
Cloud Girl: Sure, let’s feel things out first!
Alfie: It looks like someone needs help taking their groceries back to their dorm. They just got off the bus and are stranded with too much to carry.
Cloud Girl: That sounds pretty critical. We wouldn't want any frozen items to go bad. Looks like a job for Cloud Girl!
Alfie: Roger that. We'll review the other requests after we're done with this. 
Cloud Girl: Sounds good! What's their location?

Alfie: Not far, it's the bus stop closest to you.
Cloud Girl: Should I teleport in or keep things down-low?

Alfie: Keep things uneventful for now. We don't want to attract too much attention this early. 
Cloud Girl: Got it.
Alfie: Should I send out our usual active patrol announcement? 
Cloud Girl: Definitely! I'm just getting started.
System: BLOG UPDATED TO ACTIVE DUTY

[TELEPORT_IN]
Alfie: Might as well make a flashy entrance! That'll put you on the radar, but I'm sure they'll appreciate the quick help. 
Cloud Girl: Got it. It'll take me two bursts, then I'll identify the targets.

Alfie: That’s it?
Cloud Girl: I'm all done! What's next?
Alfie: Let me refresh everything, see what's changed.
Cloud Girl: You know what would be cute? If I started carrying around reusable bags. The little ones, where they zip up all nice and then you pull them out to have a bag. 
Alfie: You expect to be helping with a lot more people's grocery runs?
Cloud Girl: Wouldn't hurt to be prepared! Plus, we could get cute custom-made cloud shaped ones. It would be on brand!

Like the idea | Hesitant about it | Think the idea is tacky

[THINK_THE_IDEA_IS_TACKY]
Alfie: Really? Branded merchandise already? Might be a bit tacky. 
Cloud Girl: Maybe you're right. We can put merch aside for the moment. Revisit it later.
Alfie: I'll put a pin in it.


[HESITANT_ABOUT_IT]
Alfie: Might be tricky, I don't exactly have Cloud Girl merch in the budget.
Cloud Girl: We have a budget?
Alfie: Exactly.


[LIKE_THE_IDEA]
Alfie: That's not a bad idea. Not something we could immediately set in motion, but I could look into some options.
Cloud Girl: That's the Alfie I know!
Alfie: Ha, okay, but don't get your hopes up. I can't promise anything.
