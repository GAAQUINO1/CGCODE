Alfie: Oh damn, someone's dealing with a faulty dryer and no time to get to class. 
Cloud Girl: There's no time to waste. What's the location. 

[PITCH_OPTION]
Alfie: It looks like someone's going to be late to class on account of a dryer malfunction. 
Cloud Girl: Oh no! We've got to help them ASAP. Can you figure out the location? 

[MERGE]
Alfie: From the context clues and what I could find from their other posts on ASAP. Can you figure out the location? 
Cloud Girl: I can teleport there in no time at all. Hold, please! 
Cloud Girl: Alright, I've got the laundry room in my sights. 
Alfie: Do you see someone who fits the description? 
Cloud Girl: Yeah, there's someone looking about ready to kick the dryer. Probably our guy. 
Alfie: Perfect. 
Cloud Girl: How do you think I should go about this? I'm sure anyone would be skeptical to trust someone else with their property.

Be Cloud Girl | Be down to earth | Be yourself

Alfie: You're Cloud Girl! Lean in. 
Cloud Girl: That's nothing to be worried about, not when I'm here. 
Alfie: And I'm here if you need any additional backup.

Alfie: We did essentially cyber-stalk this person to try and help their laundry. Maybe go for the relatable approach? 
Cloud Girl: Relatable... Yeah! This could happen to anyone. Even Cloud Girl. 
Alfie: I'll be here in case the relatable proves difficult. 
Cloud Girl: Hey. I'm extremely down to earth. 
Alfie: Alright then, prove it.

Alfie: Be yourself. 
Cloud Girl: Like, my alter-ego? Or are we going for the angle where Cloud Girl shrunk her coat in the wash. 
Alfie: Alter-ego. I mean, we're all human. Cloud Girl, she's a symbol. That doesn't always work. 
Cloud Girl: If you're sure. 
Alfie: Remember that time you managed to put a pen in your laundry? 
Cloud Girl: I did not put a pen in the laundry. I forgot that I had it in my pocket. And I am still finding ink stains on my clothes.
Alfie: See? Their laundry issues could be worse. They could be you. 
Cloud Girl: After I'm done here, I'm sneaking some ink cartridges into your socks. See how you like that. 
Alfie: It'll be my noble duty to inform the world of your turn to evil. 
Cloud Girl: Shush, you. I'm heading in.

Alfie: How's that laundry? 
Cloud Girl: It's definitely looking dryer. 
Alfie: We can only hope. 
Cloud Girl: Think I can get you in the wig and costume one of these days? 
Cloud Girl: Don't get me wrong, I love helping folks, but staying put in one room is drying me crazy. 
Alfie: No. 
Cloud Girl: What? I don't have lice.
Alfie: You do have puns, and I'm far more worried about how infectious those may be. 
Cloud Girl: Come on, I know you'll warm up to the idea... Just like this laundry is. 
Alfie: I'm muting the call.

I paid the price | Laundry should be free | Donation time

[I_PAID_THE_PRICE]
Alfie: Okay, but that's conveniently forgetting how I paid for it. 
Cloud Girl: We're a team! We both are putting our resources towards the good of this community. 
Alfie: I'd tell you to get a job, but this is your job. 
Alfie: At least tell me you're going to add this to your resume as community service hours? 
Cloud Girl: If you can figure out a way I can do it without revealing my identity, I'll consider it. 
Alfie: What am I saying. You don't even have a resume!
Cloud Girl: I take pride in my alter ego's mundanity, alright? 
Alfie: I say this with kindness. You should be extremely proud. 
Cloud Girl: Thanks!

[LAUNDRY_SHOULD_BE_FREE]
Alfie: Absolutely absurd to have to pay for laundry on the college campus you're paying to live on. 
Cloud Girl: Some things are simply out of my control as a hero. 
Alfie: That's the true injustice. We got to power you up to fight against the evils of laundromats everywhere. 
Cloud Girl: Sounds like a plan to me! 

[DONATION_TIME]
Alfie: I think we're going to need to consider some way of getting money to support all this. 
Cloud Girl: I'm not sure if that's a good idea. What if people try to bribe me? 
Alfie: We'd figure out how to frame it correctly. 
Alfie: Make it an option for people to support you, no strings involved. 
Cloud Girl: I'll think about it.

Alfie: Up for another mission?
